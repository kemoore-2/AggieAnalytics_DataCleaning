Aggie Analytics Senior Project

The development of the Aggie Basketball Data Analytics Application followed a structured, four-phase timeline, designed to leverage each team member's specific strengths.

The project began with establishing a data foundation, led by Kenton. His primary responsibility was sourcing disparate raw data from the official N.C. A&T athletics website and external sports databases.

This involved manually gathering PDF box scores and CSV files for both Men’s and Women’s basketball and standardizing them into a consistent format suitable for backend processing. Without this crucial step of normalizing unstructured data, the subsequent visualization and modeling phases would not have been possible.
